# Dropbox

Codepath week 1 assignment

Description: The purpose of this homework is to use Xcode to implement the flow between the screens of an application.
    We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Dropbox app from the signed out state to the
    basic signed in state.
Hours: 10
Optionals:
    Add a detail view for one of the files and implement favoriting the file.
    Add UITextFields for the forms so you can actually type in them and handle dismissing the keyboard.
    You should be able to swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.
